The data preprocessing for training involved randomly sampling a timestep and not masking any tokens before this timestep. Conditioning tokens were never masked, and a masking scheme was designed to proceed by sampling the prompt delimiter timestep and the current RVQ level.

The paper provides information on how the data was preprocessed for training:

"To extract semantic tokens, we train a 0.6B parameter BEST-RQ (Chiu et al., 2022) on this dataset and fit k-means with 4096 cluster centers to the activations of layer 13 of the BEST-RQ model. This results in 25 semantic tokens per second, with a codebook size of 4096."
