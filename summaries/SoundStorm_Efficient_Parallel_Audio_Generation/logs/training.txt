The paper provides information on the training process, including the masking scheme and the masking procedure during training. The masking scheme involves randomly sampling a timestep and a RVQ level for training. The conditioning tokens are never masked, and the masking is designed to enable voice prompting.

The text related to how the neural network was trained is as follows:

"We train the model on LibriLight (Kahn et al., 2020) (60k hours), with 10 epochs over the data, sampling random windows of length between 0 and 30 seconds from each example."

The paper provides information on the training of the neural network used in the study. Specifically, it mentions the training of a ByT5-large Transformer model for text-to-semantic token mapping. The model has 1.2B parameters, with 36 encoder and 12 decoder layers, embedding size of 1536, and feed-forward dimension of 3840. The training only involves the decoder, and a text-pretrained encoder from a published ByT5 checkpoint is used. The model takes a byte-level representation of the text as input and predicts non-deduplicated semantic tokens. Decoding is performed by temperature sampling with a temperature of 0.9 and top-k set to 125.

The paper mentions the training details as follows: "We train both the text-to-semantic model and SoundStorm on the dialogue corpus for 10 epochs."
