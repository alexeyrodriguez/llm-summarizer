#### Training Process:
- **Two-stage training:** S1 for mapping text to semantic tokens, S2 for mapping semantic to acoustic tokens
- **Pretraining tasks:** Denoising pretext task for encoder-decoder Transformer
- **Backtranslation:** Generating synthetic parallel data from audio-only corpus
- **Model Training:** Using synthetic data for initial training, followed by finetuning on original parallel data
- **Inference:** Autoregressive generation of target acoustic tokens with noise control

#### Experimental Setup:
- **Datasets:** LibriLight for self-supervised representation models, LJSpeech for training S1
- **Sampling:** Subsets of different sizes from training set for limited data scenarios

#### Results:
- **Evaluation:** Character Error Rate (CER) for different training scenarios and data amounts
- **Impact:** Pretraining and backtranslation on CER improvement
