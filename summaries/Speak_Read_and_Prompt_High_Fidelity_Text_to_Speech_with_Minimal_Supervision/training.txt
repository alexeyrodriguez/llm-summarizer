Summary of Neural Network Training Procedure and Hyperparameters:

Training Procedure:
- Pretraining an encoder-decoder model on a denoising task using a semantic-token representation of speech-only data.
- Finetuning the decoder through backtranslation using a small parallel dataset.
- Transcribing speech-only data to create a synthetic parallel dataset for further training.
- Finetuning the encoder for translation using the synthetic dataset and original parallel data.
- Training S1 on the LJSpeech dataset.
- Training self-supervised representation models on the LibriLight dataset.
- Random selection of subsets of data for training in low-resource scenarios.

Hyperparameters:
- Optimizer: Adafactor
- Learning rate decay: Square-root
- Regularization method: Label smoothing with a smoothing parameter of 0.1
- Probability of deleting individual tokens during pretraining: 0.6
- Dropout probability: 0.5
- Batch size: 256
- Pretraining updates: 1 million
- Architecture: T5-Large
- Number of layers in T5-Large: 24

Overall, the training procedure involves a combination of pretraining, finetuning, and data synthesis techniques, while the hyperparameters include details on optimization, regularization, and model architecture.
