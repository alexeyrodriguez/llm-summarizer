The paper does not provide specific information related to how the neural network was trained, such as batch size, learning rate, number of epochs or steps, or losses. The focus of the paper is on the methodology and approach used in building the TTS system, particularly emphasizing the use of pretraining, backtranslation, and self-supervised audio representations to achieve high-quality speech synthesis.

The paper provides information on how the neural network was trained for the SPEAR-TTS system. The training process involves two stages: the first stage (S1) focuses on mapping tokenized text into semantic tokens, while the second stage (S2) maps semantic tokens to acoustic tokens. The paper mentions that the second stage (S2) can be trained using audio-only data, which is beneficial due to the larger scale of available audio-only data compared to parallel data.

Additionally, the paper discusses approaches used to train the Transformer seq2seq models for the first stage (S1) of the system. It mentions pretraining the encoder-decoder Transformer on a denoising pretext task, where the model is provided with a corrupted version of an original semantic token sequence and tasked with producing the corresponding uncorrupted token sequence. The paper also discusses backtranslation as a method to generate synthetic parallel data from an audio-only corpus to train the speech-to-text model.

The training process involves pretraining the model on the denoising task and then fine-tuning it for the S1 task by freezing upper layers of the encoder and updating lower layers based on a hyperparameter-defined number of layers to tune.

The paper provides details on the training process of the neural network, including pretraining and backtranslation. The training process involves pretraining an encoder-decoder model on a denoising task using a semantic-token representation of speech-only data. The decoder is then finetuned to backtranslate semantic tokens to transcripts using a small parallel dataset. This model is then used to transcribe speech-only data and generate a synthetic parallel dataset. The synthetic dataset is further used to finetune the encoder for translation in the forward direction. Additionally, the paper mentions freezing the encoder and only finetuning the decoder for backtranslation model training. The process involves using synthetically generated parallel data to train the first stage of the text-to-speech (TTS) system, followed by finetuning on the original parallel data.

The paper provides details on how the neural network was trained, including the process during training and the experimental setup. During training, the model randomly selects two non-overlapping windows of speech from each training example to compute sequences of semantic and acoustic tokens. One window is considered the prompt, and the other is the target output. The sequences are concatenated in the order of semantic tokens from the prompt, semantic tokens from the target, acoustic tokens from the prompt, and acoustic tokens from the target. The model learns to generate the target acoustic tokens while preserving the speaker identity captured by the acoustic tokens from the prompt. 

At inference time, the model is provided with the input sequences (semantic and acoustic tokens) and generates the target acoustic tokens autoregressively. A special separator token is added at each segment boundary to prevent boundary artifacts. The paper also discusses controlling the noise level in the synthesized speech at inference time, including selecting cleaner prompts and using stochastic sampling with a no-reference audio quality metric.

In terms of the experimental setup, the paper mentions using LibriLight for training the self-supervised representation models and k-means for discretizing embeddings into semantic tokens. The first stage of training, S1, is conducted on the LJSpeech dataset, which is a single-speaker dataset containing 24 hours of parallel data. The paper also describes how subsets of different sizes are sampled from the training set to simulate scenarios with limited data availability.

"Ultimately, we resort to subjective tests with human raters to compare the quality of SPEAR-TTS with the baselines and with ground-truth natural speech. We focus on the scenario with minimal supervision and use the S1 model that is trained with the 15 minute LJSpeech subset. As baselines, we use the FastSpeech2-LR models trained on 15 minutes, 1 hour, and 24 hour subsets of LJSpeech."

The text related to how the neural network was trained in the machine learning paper is as follows:

"In this Section, we study intelligibility of SPEAR-TTS with S1 trained on LibriTTS. We generally use the same hyperparameter grids as in experiments with LJSpeech (Ito and Johnson, 2017) that are reported in Section 7. However, as LibriTTS is larger than LJSpeech, we also experiment with encoder-decoder models. For the largest training subset of LibriTTS (551h), we also experimented with T5-Large-sized encoder-decoder and decoder-only architectures (24 layers). For encoder-decoder models, we always set the numbers of layers in the encoder and the decoder to be equal."
