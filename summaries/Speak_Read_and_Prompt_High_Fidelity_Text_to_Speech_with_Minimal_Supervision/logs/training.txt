The paper provides details on how the neural network was trained, including pretraining methods such as denoising pretext task and backtranslation. The training process involves freezing upper layers of the encoder and fine-tuning lower layers for the S1 task. The exact number of layers to tune is a hyperparameter.

The paper describes the training process of the neural network as follows:

"We start with pretraining an encoder-decoder model on a denoising task, using a semantic-token representation of speech-only data. Next, we finetune its decoder to backtranslate using a small parallel dataset. Then, we use this model to transcribe the speech-only dataset and obtain a synthetic parallel dataset. In turn, this synthetic dataset is used to finetune the encoder for 'translation' in the forward direction, along with the original small parallel dataset."

The paper provides details on how the neural network was trained, including the use of LibriLight dataset for training the self-supervised representation models, training S1 on the LJSpeech dataset, and the random selection of subsets of data for training in low-resource scenarios.

The text related to how the neural network was trained is as follows:

"When evaluating SPEAR-TTS, we consider the following training settings for S1: (a) training from scratch using parallel data; (b) finetuning the pretrained checkpoint P using parallel data; (c) finetuning the pretrained checkpoint P to obtain the backtranslation model and then training the forward model from scratch on the synthetically generated data; (d) same as (c), but both the backward and the forward models are obtained by finetuning P with an additional finetuning of the forward model on the original parallel data."
