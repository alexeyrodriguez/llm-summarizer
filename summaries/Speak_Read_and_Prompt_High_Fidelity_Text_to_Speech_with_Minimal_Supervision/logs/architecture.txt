Context:
Page 0:
The neural network architecture in the paper involves splitting the TTS task into two sub-tasks: translating text to semantic tokens and translating semantic tokens to acoustic tokens. This approach allows for decoupling the supervision needed for each task, enabling training of the "speaking" component using self-supervised audio models and abundant unlabeled speech data.

Page 1:
The neural network architecture used in the paper is based on a seq2seq model, specifically leveraging standard Transformer models like BART/T5-style pretraining and backtranslation to reduce the need for supervision in training SPEAR-TTS.

Page 2:
The neural network architecture described in the paper is a two-stage model called SPEAR-TTS. The first stage, S1, maps tokenized text into semantic tokens using Transformer architectures. The second stage, S2, maps semantic tokens to acoustic tokens for speech synthesis.

Page 3:
The neural network architecture involves a large speech-only dataset for pretraining, utilizing an encoder-decoder model for backtranslation and fine-tuning. The model leverages semantic token representations to reduce computational complexity and facilitate training in both forward and backward directions. The process includes freezing the encoder, finetuning the decoder, and controlling the generation process with a second stage model mapping semantic tokens to acoustic tokens.

Page 4:
The neural network architecture described in the paper involves prompted generation, where semantic and acoustic tokens are concatenated in a specific order during training to generate target acoustic tokens. The model learns to preserve speaker identity and voice conditions from the prompt tokens. At inference time, the model generates acoustic tokens autoregressively based on the input tokens. A special separator token is used to prevent boundary artifacts.
