The paper discusses the evaluation of the SPEAR-TTS system, stating that it achieves a character error rate competitive with state-of-the-art methods using only 15 minutes of parallel data, while matching ground-truth speech in terms of naturalness and acoustic quality, as measured in subjective tests.

Page 1:
The evaluation of the neural network in the paper is as follows:

"Our experimental study on English speech shows that, by combining pretraining and back-translation over a large dataset — 551 hours from LibriTTS (Zen et al., 2019) — with just 15 minutes of parallel data from a single speaker — LJSpeech (Ito and Johnson, 2017) — SPEAR-TTS (a) generates speech with high fidelity to the input transcript — CER 1.92% on LibriSpeech test-clean (Panayotov et al., 2015)); (b) synthesizes speech with diverse voices, (c) reliably reproduces the voice of an unseen speaker, when using a 3-second example from the target speaker; (d) achieves high acoustic quality, comparable to that of the ground-truth utterances (MOS 4.96 vs. 4.92)."

The paper discusses the evaluation of the neural network in the context of training Transformer seq2seq models with substantial amounts of parallel data, as well as the use of backtranslation to generate synthetic parallel data from an audio-only corpus.

The paper discusses the experimental setup, including the datasets, metrics, and baselines used in the study. The training data includes acoustic and semantic tokens from the LibriLight dataset for training self-supervised representation models. The first stage, S1, is trained on the LJSpeech dataset, a single-speaker dataset containing 24 hours of parallel data. The study also explores scenarios with limited data by sampling subsets of different sizes from the training set.

The evaluation metrics used to assess the properties of SPEAR-TTS in the paper include:

- Character Error Rate (CER)
- Voice diversity
- Voice preservation
- Quality

The evaluation of the neural network model FastSpeech2-LR was conducted in comparison to Tacotron2, showing comparable performance with significantly less training data. Additionally, the model was compared to VALL-E, a TTS system demonstrating state-of-the-art results in zero-shot voice adaptation.

Page 7:
The evaluation of the neural network in the paper includes measuring the faithfulness of the generated speech to the input transcript, assessing the diversity of voices generated, and controlling speaker voice without degradation in fidelity to the transcript. The evaluation is done based on metrics such as Character Error Rate (CER) to determine the intelligibility of the generated speech.

Page 8:
Table 3 reports the speaker accuracy, that is, how often the same voice is detected in both the prompt and the generated speech. We observe top-1 accuracy equal to 92.4% showing that the prompting allows SPEAR-TTS to preserve the speaker voice. Also, the synthesized voice is stable when repeating inference, as captured by a low value of voice variability (0.41 bits). Moreover, we observe that with prompted generation SPEAR-TTS achieves a CER equal to 1.92%, which is lower than without prompting (2.21%).

Page 9:
The evaluation of the neural network in the paper includes metrics such as cosine similarity and Mean Opinion Score (MOS) to compare the voice preservation and quality of the SPEAR-TTS model with baselines and ground-truth natural speech. The results show that SPEAR-TTS outperforms the baselines and achieves high speech quality despite being trained on only 15 minutes of parallel data.

The evaluation of the neural network in the paper includes Mean Opinion Score (MOS) results for different systems trained on subsets of LJSpeech, with comparisons and confidence intervals provided.

Page 11:
The evaluation of the neural network in the paper includes comparisons with other systems and metrics such as accuracy and cosine similarity. The paper states that "SPEAR-TTS achieves intelligibility comparable to that of an adapted FastSpeech2-LR" and "SPEAR-TTS obtains a cosine similarity of 0.56" in terms of speaker similarity. Additionally, subjective evaluations show that "SPEAR-TTS has significantly higher quality than a strong single-voice baseline" with a MOS score of 4.96.

The text related to the evaluation of the neural network in the paper is as follows:

"In the future, one can explore other approaches for detecting synthesized speech, e.g. audio watermarking. As an initial step, we verify that speech produced by SPEAR-TTS can be reliably detected by a classifier with an accuracy of 82.5% on a balanced dataset."

The text related to the evaluation of the neural network in the context is as follows:

"We report the results of this experiment in Table 7. We observe that increasing ns leads to a higher estimated quality. Moreover, higher audio quality allows SPEAR-TTS to achieve lower CER. Based on the results in Table 7, we use ns = 3 in all our experiments, as a trade-off between the computational complexity and the estimated quality estimate."

The paper provides evaluation results for the neural network, specifically in Table 10, which shows the Character Error Rate (CER) of SPEAR-TTS using a grapheme-based text representation. The results indicate that the model achieved a CER of 2.21% with 15 minutes of parallel data.

The evaluation of the neural network in the paper includes the following information:

"Downsample factor 1 2 5 10
CER (%) 1.99 1.99 2.36 2.92
We notice that reducing the data size 5x starts to affect the performance."
