Please consider the details for the dataset used in the neural network training provided in the context below
and provide an overall summary for the dataset used.


Context:
Page 0:
The paper does not mention the specific dataset used to train the neural network for the SPEAR-TTS system.

Page 1:
The dataset used to train the neural network in the machine learning paper is as follows:

"Our experimental study on English speech shows that, by combining pretraining and back-translation over a large dataset — 551 hours from LibriTTS (Zen et al., 2019) — with just 15 minutes of parallel data from a single speaker — LJSpeech (Ito and Johnson, 2017) — SPEAR-TTS..."

The paper does not explicitly mention the dataset used to train the neural network.

Page 3:
The paper used a large speech-only dataset for pretraining and a small parallel dataset for backtranslation.

Page 4:
The dataset used to train the neural network in the machine learning paper is LibriLight for acoustic and semantic tokens.

Page 5:
The dataset used to train the neural network in the machine learning paper is LibriLight (Kahn et al., 2020) for pretraining and LibriTTS (Zen et al., 2019) for backtranslation.

Page 6:
The dataset used to train the neural network in the paper is LJSpeech.

Page 7:
The paper used the LJSpeech dataset for training the neural network.

Page 8:
The paper does not explicitly mention the dataset used to train the neural network.

Page 9:
The dataset used to train the neural network in the paper is the 15-minute LJSpeech subset.

Page 10:
The dataset used to train the neural network in the paper is subsets of LJSpeech (Ito and Johnson, 2017).

Page 11:
The dataset used to train the V ALL-E neural network is the "60,000 hours of ASR-transcribed LibriLight."

Page 12:
The dataset used to train the neural network in the machine learning paper is LibriLight. The paper mentions, "Next, we rely on LibriLight (Kahn et al., 2020) as our audio-only dataset which provides a sufficiently diverse set of audio."
