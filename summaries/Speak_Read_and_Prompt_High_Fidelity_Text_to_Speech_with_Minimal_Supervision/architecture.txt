Summary of the neural network architecture described in the context:

The neural network architecture in the paper is a two-stage model called SPEAR-TTS. The first stage (S1) involves mapping tokenized text into semantic tokens using Transformer architectures, while the second stage (S2) maps semantic tokens to acoustic tokens for speech synthesis. The model leverages standard Transformer models like T5-Large and specific configurations for the decoder-only Transformer model in S2. The architecture involves pretraining on a large speech-only dataset, backtranslation, and fine-tuning using encoder-decoder models. The model also incorporates prompted generation, where semantic and acoustic tokens are concatenated during training to generate target acoustic tokens while preserving speaker identity and voice conditions. Additionally, the architecture includes training a T5-small encoder-decoder model for the bandwidth extension task and experimenting with different architectures for training S1 on LibriTTS. The neural codec used for producing acoustic tokens can be changed to enhance the quality of SPEAR-TTS.
