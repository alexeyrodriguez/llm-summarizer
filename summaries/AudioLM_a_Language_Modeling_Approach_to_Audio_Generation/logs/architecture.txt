The neural network architecture information extracted from the paper is as follows:

"We propose AudioLM, a framework for audio generation that combines semantic and acoustic tokens in a hierarchical fashion to achieve long-term consistency and high quality."

Page 1:
The paper discusses the use of AudioLM for generating high-quality audio sequences by combining semantic and acoustic tokens in a generative framework. This approach aims to improve upon existing methods by preserving the original speaker's identity and intonation in speech continuations and extending audio continuation to piano sequences with high-level coherence.

The neural network architecture described in the paper involves a hybrid tokenization scheme with a multi-stage Transformer-based language model. The components include a tokenizer model, a decoder-only Transformer language model, and a detokenizer model. The tokenizer and detokenizer are pre-trained and frozen before training the language model. The model operates on discrete tokens to increase the temporal context size and simplify the training setup.

The neural network architecture described in the paper involves a hierarchical modeling approach, where semantic tokens are first modeled for the entire sequence and then used as conditioning to predict the acoustic tokens. This hierarchical modeling approach aims to ensure long-term consistency and high-quality audio synthesis by capturing linguistic content and acoustic details, respectively.

The neural network architecture in the paper involves a hierarchical modeling approach for semantic and acoustic tokens in AudioLM. It consists of three stages: semantic modeling for long-term structural coherence, coarse acoustic modeling conditioned on semantic tokens, and fine acoustic modeling. The second and third stages are separate to limit sequence length and improve audio quality.

The neural network architecture information extracted from the paper is as follows:

"We use identical decoder-only Transformers in all stages, with 12 layers, 16 attention heads, embedding dimension of 1024, feed-forward layer dimension of 4096 and dropout of 0.1, together with T5-style relative positional embeddings, resulting in a model parameter size of 0.3B per stage."

The neural network architecture used in the paper is a convolutional network for speaker classification, composed of six convolution blocks with convolutions along the time and frequency axes, followed by ReLU and batch normalization.

The text related to the neural network architecture in the paper is as follows:

"Unlike AudioLM, the aforementioned models are not causal, so they are not well suited for speech generation. Hence, we also consider causal baselines. Firstly, we include a variant of GSLM that achieves the best sWUGGY and sBLIMP scores reported in Lakhotia et al. [14]. This model is a decoder-only Transformer language model trained using quantized HuBERT representations [33]. Next, we include the entry of van Niekerk et al. [62], obtaining the highest scores in the challenge among causal models with an LSTM model trained on CPC-based speech tokens."

The neural network architecture used in the AudioLM framework involves a hybrid tokenization scheme of semantic and acoustic tokens, performing autoregressive prediction through three stages of language modeling that generate audio from the coarsest semantic level up to the finest acoustic details.
