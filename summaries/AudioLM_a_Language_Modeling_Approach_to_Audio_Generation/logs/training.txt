The paper provides information related to how the neural network was trained. Here is the extracted text verbatim:

"•We propose AudioLM, a framework for audio generation
that combines semantic and acoustic tokens in a hierar-
chical fashion to achieve long-term consistency and high
quality.
•We compare the semantic tokens extracted from a pre-
trained w2v-BERT [17] and the acoustic tokens from
SoundStream [16] on a speech dataset, and we show
that they complement each other in terms of phonetic
discriminability and reconstruction quality."

The neural network was trained using random cropping to equivalent input lengths of 30, 10, and 3 seconds for the three stages. The training involved removing consecutive repetitions of the semantic tokens in the first two stages. Each stage was trained on 16 TPUv4s with a batch size of 256 for 1M steps.

The text related to how the neural network was trained in the paper is as follows:

"Unlike AudioLM, the aforementioned models are not causal, so they are not well suited for speech generation. Hence, we also consider causal baselines. Firstly, we include a variant of GSLM that achieves the best sWUGGY and sBLIMP scores reported in Lakhotia et al. [14]. This model is a decoder-only Transformer language model trained using quantized HuBERT representations [33]. Next, we include the entry of van Niekerk et al. [62], obtaining the highest scores in the challenge among causal models with an LSTM model trained on CPC-based speech tokens."

The text related to how the neural network was trained in the context extracted from the machine learning paper is as follows:

"For training, we extract the original samples and prompts from LibriSpeech train-clean-100. We train on crops of 1 seconds, and compute predictions on longer sequences with the same approach as described in Section IV-D. On a balanced evaluation set, this model achieves 98.6% accuracy. The model hyperparameters are identical to the speech continuation setup, except for the acoustic generation stage: we found that a codec with 3 layers of quantization and a larger codebook size of 214 per layer already provides high reconstruction quality, so the experiments on piano continuation ignore the third stage and directly predict the 3 levels of acoustic tokens in the second stage."
