The paper provides information related to how the neural network was trained:

- "By training on large corpora of raw audio waveforms, AudioLM learns to generate natural and coherent continuations given short prompts."
- "When trained on speech, and without any transcript or annotation, AudioLM generates syntactically and semantically plausible speech continuations while also maintaining speaker identity and prosody for unseen speakers."
- "Training a language model to generate both semantic and acoustic tokens leads simultaneously to high audio quality and long-term consistency."

The paper provides information on the training of a convolutional network for speaker classification, including details on the architecture and training data used. The network is trained on the union of LibriSpeech train-clean-100 and test-clean datasets, with 291 speakers in total. The dataset is split randomly, with 90% used for training and 10% for evaluation. The classifier achieves almost perfect accuracy on the evaluation split of the dataset.
