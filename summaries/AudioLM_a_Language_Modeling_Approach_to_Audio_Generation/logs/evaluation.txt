The paper introduces AudioLM, a framework for high-quality audio generation with long-term consistency. AudioLM maps the input audio to a sequence of discrete tokens and casts audio generation as a language modeling task in this representation space. The authors propose a hybrid tokenization scheme to achieve both reconstruction quality and long-term structure by leveraging a masked language model pre-trained on audio and a neural audio codec. The contributions of the paper include the proposal of AudioLM, comparison of semantic and acoustic tokens, demonstration of coherent speech generation without textual annotations, and suitability for music generation.

The paper provides information related to the evaluation of the neural network, specifically in terms of phonetic discriminability and reconstruction quality. Phonetic discriminability is measured by ABX error rate, while reconstruction quality is reported in ViSQOL units. The results show that acoustic tokens provide good reconstruction quality but poor phonetic discriminability, while semantic tokens from w2v-BERT improve phonetic discriminability but do not achieve high reconstruction quality.

The evaluation of the neural network model involved inspecting ABX, sWUGGY, and sBLIMP scores computed for different layers of the MLM module of w2v-BERT. The best candidate was identified as the 7th layer in the MLM module of w2v-BERT XL with 1024 clusters.

The results of the evaluation of the neural network are as follows:

"Table II shows the results, where the low WER and CER achieved by AudioLM provide two important insights. First, we can conclude that the semantic content is fully captured by the semantic tokens, as the transcripts obtained from the output of acoustic generation closely follow the original transcripts. Second, the acoustic generation based on sampling SoundStream tokens and decoding them to audio samples preserves good transcription quality."

"The classifier achieves almost perfect accuracy on the evaluation split of the dataset, and Table III shows that it is also robust to lossy compression introduced by SoundStream."

"Table III shows that, while higher than chance (3.2% compared to 100/ 291 = 0.3%), the speaker classification accuracy remains low in this case. We can conclude that the semantic tokens carry little information about the speaker identity, which is instead mostly determined by the acoustic tokens."

The evaluation of the neural network model AudioLM is presented in Table IV, where it achieves the highest sWUGGY scores across both splits and also attains the highest score in the sBLIMP metric, improving by 8% relative over the previous state-of-the-art (CPC-BERT [59]). The model demonstrates a high ability to model linguistic content without any textual supervision and significantly improves over previous work in terms of lexical and syntactic judgement quality.

The model achieves 98.6% accuracy on a balanced evaluation set.
