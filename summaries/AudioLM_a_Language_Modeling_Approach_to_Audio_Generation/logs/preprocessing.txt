The data preprocessing for training involved computing acoustic tokens using SoundStream, a neural audio codec, and semantic tokens using w2v-BERT, a self-supervised audio representation model. SoundStream utilized a convolutional encoder with a residual vector quantizer to produce embeddings at a reduced sampling rate, while w2v-BERT employed a Conformer-based model with k-means clustering on intermediate layer embeddings to generate semantic tokens.

The paper provides information on how the data was preprocessed for training. Specifically, it mentions using w2v-BERT XL with a set of heuristics for choosing the intermediate layer to quantize and the number of k-means clusters K. The best candidate was identified as the 7th layer in the MLM module of w2v-BERT XL with K=1024 clusters.
