Based on the details provided in the context, the datasets used to train the neural networks in the papers mentioned are as follows:

1. Libri-Light dataset
2. unlab-60k train split of Libri-Light (60k hours of English speech)
3. LibriSpeech dev-clean
4. Union of LibriSpeech train-clean-100 and test-clean (291 speakers in total)
5. LibriSpeech train-clean-100
6. MAESTRO dataset (for piano music modeling and generation)

Overall Summary:
The neural networks in the papers were trained using various datasets such as Libri-Light, LibriSpeech, and MAESTRO. These datasets contain speech and music data for tasks like speech recognition, speaker classification, and music generation. The datasets vary in terms of content, size, and specific focus, providing diverse training data for the neural networks in the respective papers.
