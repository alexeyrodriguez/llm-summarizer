Based on the information provided in the context, the data preprocessing for training in the machine learning paper involved the following steps:

1. Spectral analysis with pre-emphasis of 0.97.
2. Frame length of 50 ms.
3. Frame shift of 12.5 ms.
4. Use of a Hann window type.
5. Using a vanilla seq2seq model with 2 layers of residual RNNs, each layer having 256 GRU cells.
6. No pre-net or post-processing net was used.
7. The decoder directly predicted linear-scale log magnitude spectrogram.
8. Scheduled sampling with a sampling rate of 0.5 was required for the model to learn alignments and generalize.

Overall, the data preprocessing for training involved spectral analysis, frame processing, windowing, and specific model configurations for the seq2seq model used in the paper.
