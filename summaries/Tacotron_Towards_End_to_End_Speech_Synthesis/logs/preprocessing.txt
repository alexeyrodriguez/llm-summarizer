The data preprocessing steps for training involved spectral analysis pre-emphasis of 0.97, a frame length of 50 ms, a frame shift of 12.5 ms, and the use of a Hann window type.

The data preprocessing for training in the paper involved using a vanilla seq2seq model with 2 layers of residual RNNs, each layer having 256 GRU cells. No pre-net or post-processing net was used, and the decoder directly predicted linear-scale log magnitude spectrogram. Scheduled sampling with a sampling rate of 0.5 was required for the model to learn alignments and generalize.

The text related to how the data was preprocessed for training is as follows: "We trained a model without the post-processing net while keeping all the other components untouched (except that the decoder RNN predicts linear-scale spectrogram)."
