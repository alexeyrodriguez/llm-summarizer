Page 0:
The paper presents Tacotron, an end-to-end generative text-to-speech model that synthesizes speech directly from characters. The model can be trained completely from scratch with random initialization. Several key techniques are introduced to make the sequence-to-sequence framework perform well for this challenging task. Tacotron achieves a 3.82 subjective 5-scale mean opinion score on US English, outperforming a production parametric system in terms of naturalness. Additionally, since Tacotron generates speech at the frame level, it is substantially faster than sample-level autoregressive methods.

The neural network architecture mentioned in the paper is as follows:

- Pre-net
- CBHG
- Character embeddings
- Attention
- RNNDecoder
- RNN
- Linear-scale spectrogram
- Seq2seq target with r=3
- Griffin-Lim reconstruction

Attention is applied to all decoder steps.

Page 2:
The backbone of Tacotron is a seq2seq model with attention. The model includes an encoder, an attention-based decoder, and a post-processing net. The CBHG module consists of a bank of 1-D convolutional filters, highway networks, and a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (GRU) recurrent neural net. The encoder's goal is to extract robust sequential representations of text.

The paper does not provide specific information related to the neural network architecture.

Page 5:
The neural network architecture described in the paper includes a vanilla seq2seq model with 2 layers of residual RNNs, each layer having 256 GRU cells. No pre-net or post-processing net is used, and the decoder directly predicts linear-scale log magnitude spectrogram. Scheduled sampling with a sampling rate of 0.5 is required for this model to learn alignments and generalize.

Page 6:
The neural network architecture mentioned in the paper includes a CBHG encoder and a post-processing net. The CBHG encoder is compared with a 2-layer residual GRU encoder, showing that the CBHG encoder reduces overfitting and generalizes well to long and complex phrases. The post-processing net improves the prediction by providing better resolved harmonics and high-frequency formant structure, reducing synthesis artifacts.

The neural network architecture mentioned in the paper is Tacotron, an integrated end-to-end generative TTS model that takes a character sequence as input and outputs the corresponding spectrogram.
