The paper provides the following information related to how the neural network was trained:

- Hyper-parameters and network architectures were specified in Table 1.
- The encoder and decoder pre-net structures were described.
- The decoder utilized a content-based tanh attention mechanism.
- The decoder target was set as an 80-band mel-scale spectrogram.
- Multiple, non-overlapping output frames were predicted at each decoder step to increase convergence speed.

The paper provides details on the training process of the neural network, including the batch size, learning rate, number of epochs, and losses. The model was trained using a batch size of 32, with an Adam optimizer starting from a learning rate of 0.001 and decaying to 0.0005, 0.0003, and 0.0001 after 500K, 1M, and 2M global steps, respectively. The training utilized a simple â„“1 loss for both the seq2seq decoder and post-processing net, with equal weights assigned to the two losses.

The neural network was trained with a vanilla seq2seq model using 2 layers of residual RNNs, each layer having 256 GRU cells. Scheduled sampling with a sampling rate of 0.5 was required for the model to learn alignments and generalize.
