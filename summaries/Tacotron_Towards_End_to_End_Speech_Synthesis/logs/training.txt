The paper "TACOTRON: TOWARDS END-TO-END SPEECH SYNTHESIS" presents Tacotron, an end-to-end generative text-to-speech model that synthesizes speech directly from characters. The model can be trained completely from scratch with random initialization. Several key techniques are introduced to make the sequence-to-sequence framework perform well for this challenging task. Tacotron achieves a 3.82 subjective 5-scale mean opinion score on US English, outperforming a production parametric system in terms of naturalness. Additionally, since Tacotron generates speech at the frame level, it is substantially faster than sample-level autoregressive methods.

I'm sorry, but the text provided does not contain specific information related to how the neural network was trained, such as batch size, learning rate, number of epochs or steps, or losses. The text primarily focuses on the model architecture, including the CBHG module and the encoder in the Tacotron seq2seq model with attention. If you need information on the training details, please provide additional context or specific sections from the paper that discuss the training process.

The paper provides information on the hyper-parameters and network architectures used in the neural network model. Some of the key details include:

- Spectral analysis pre-emphasis: 0.97
- Frame length: 50 ms
- Frame shift: 12.5 ms
- Window type: Hann
- Character embedding: 256-D
- Encoder CBHG Conv1D bank: K=16, conv-k-128-ReLU
- Max pooling: stride=1, width=2
- Conv1D projections: conv-3-128-ReLU → conv-3-128-Linear
- Highway net: 4 layers of FC-128-ReLU
- Bidirectional GRU: 128 cells
- Encoder pre-net: FC-256-ReLU → Dropout(0.5) → FC-128-ReLU → Dropout(0.5)
- Decoder pre-net: FC-256-ReLU → Dropout(0.5) → FC-128-ReLU → Dropout(0.5)
- Decoder RNN: 2-layer residual GRU (256 cells)
- Attention RNN: 1-layer GRU (256 cells)
- Post-processing net Conv1D bank: K=8, conv-k-128-ReLU
- CBHG Max pooling: stride=1, width=2
- Conv1D projections: conv-3-256-ReLU → conv-3-80-Linear
- Highway net: 4 layers of FC-128-ReLU
- Bidirectional GRU: 128 cells
- Reduction factor (r): 2

Additionally, the paper mentions the use of a pre-net with a bottleneck layer and dropout, as well as a CBHG module for transforming pre-net outputs into the final encoder representation. The decoder utilizes a content-based tanh attention mechanism and a stack of GRUs with vertical residual connections. The target for seq2seq decoding is an 80-band mel-scale spectrogram, and a post-processing network is used to convert the target to waveform. The paper also discusses a trick of predicting multiple, non-overlapping output frames at each decoder step to increase convergence speed.

The hyper-parameters and network architectures used in the model are listed in Table 1. The model utilizes a log magnitude spectrogram with Hann windowing, 50 ms frame length, 12.5 ms frame shift, and 2048-point Fourier transform. Additionally, pre-emphasis (0.97) is applied, and a sampling rate of 24 kHz is used for all experiments. The output layer reduction factor, denoted as r, is set to 2 for the results presented in the paper, although larger r values such as r=5 also yield good performance. The Adam optimizer with learning rate decay is employed, starting from 0.001 and decreasing to 0.0005, 0.0003, and 0.0001 after 500K, 1M, and 2M global steps, respectively. The model is trained using a batch size of 32, with sequences padded to a maximum length. The loss function used is a simple ℓ1 loss for both the seq2seq decoder (mel-scale spectrogram) and the post-processing net (linear-scale spectrogram), with equal weights assigned to both losses.

Page 5:
The neural network in the paper was trained using a vanilla seq2seq model with specific configurations. The encoder and decoder both utilized 2 layers of residual RNNs, with each layer containing 256 GRU cells. No pre-net or post-processing net was employed, and the decoder directly predicted linear-scale log magnitude spectrogram. Scheduled sampling with a sampling rate of 0.5 was found to be necessary for the model to learn alignments and generalize effectively.

Page 6:
The text related to how the neural network was trained is as follows:

"We trained a model without the post-processing net while keeping all the other components untouched (except that the decoder RNN predicts linear-scale spectrogram)."
