The paper presents Tacotron, an end-to-end generative text-to-speech model that synthesizes speech directly from characters. Tacotron achieves a 3.82 subjective 5-scale mean opinion score on US English, outperforming a production parametric system in terms of naturalness.

The paper evaluates the Tacotron model for text-to-speech synthesis and reports a mean opinion score (MOS) of 3.82 on a US English evaluation set, outperforming a production parametric system in terms of naturalness.

The paper discusses an ablation analysis to understand key components in the model, highlighting the importance of visual comparisons over objective metrics. The vanilla seq2seq model with scheduled sampling is compared, showing poor alignment in the learned attention.

Page 6:
The paper evaluates the neural network model by comparing different components and conducting Mean Opinion Score (MOS) tests to assess the naturalness of the synthesized stimuli.

Page 7:
The mean opinion score evaluation results are as follows:

- Tacotron: 3.82±0.085
- Parametric: 3.69±0.109
- Concatenative: 4.09±0.119
