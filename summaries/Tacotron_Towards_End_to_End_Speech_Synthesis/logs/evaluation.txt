The paper presents Tacotron, an end-to-end generative text-to-speech model that synthesizes speech directly from characters. Tacotron achieves a 3.82 subjective 5-scale mean opinion score on US English, outperforming a production parametric system in terms of naturalness. Additionally, Tacotron generates speech at the frame level, making it substantially faster than sample-level autoregressive methods.

The paper proposes Tacotron, an end-to-end generative TTS model based on the sequence-to-sequence with attention paradigm. Tacotron achieves a 3.82 mean opinion score (MOS) on a US English eval set, outperforming a production parametric system in terms of naturalness.

The paper discusses an ablation analysis to understand key components in the model, highlighting the importance of visual comparisons over objective metrics. The vanilla seq2seq model with scheduled sampling is compared, showing poor alignment in the learned attention.

The paper discusses the evaluation of the neural network model through mean opinion score tests conducted with native speakers to rate the naturalness of the stimuli on a 5-point Likert scale score.

The mean opinion score evaluation results are as follows:

- Tacotron: 3.82±0.085
- Parametric: 3.69±0.109
- Concatenative: 4.09±0.119
