Summary:
The paper titled "Tacotron: Towards End-to-End Speech Synthesis" introduces an end-to-end generative text-to-speech model called Tacotron. This model synthesizes speech directly from characters, eliminating the need for multiple stages typically found in traditional text-to-speech systems. Tacotron is trained from scratch with random initialization and incorporates key techniques to enhance its performance in generating speech. The model achieves a high subjective mean opinion score on US English, surpassing a production parametric system in terms of naturalness. Tacotron's ability to generate speech at the frame level also makes it faster compared to sample-level autoregressive methods. The paper discusses the model architecture, related work in the field, and highlights the advantages of an integrated end-to-end TTS system. Overall, Tacotron represents a significant advancement in speech synthesis technology, offering a more streamlined and efficient approach to generating speech from text.
