Summary:
The paper titled "Tacotron: Towards End-to-End Speech Synthesis" presents an end-to-end generative text-to-speech model called Tacotron. This model synthesizes speech directly from characters, eliminating the need for multiple stages typically found in traditional text-to-speech systems. Tacotron can be trained from scratch with random initialization and does not require phoneme-level alignment, making it scalable to large amounts of acoustic data with transcripts.

The model is based on the sequence-to-sequence framework with attention mechanisms and outputs raw spectrograms. By using various techniques to enhance the vanilla seq2seq model, Tacotron achieves a 3.82 mean opinion score on US English, surpassing a production parametric system in terms of naturalness. Additionally, Tacotron's frame-level speech generation makes it faster than sample-level autoregressive methods.

The paper discusses related works such as WaveNet and DeepVoice, highlighting Tacotron's advantages in being truly end-to-end without the need for pre-trained components. It also compares Tacotron to earlier end-to-end TTS models like Wang et al. (2016) and Char2Wav (Sotelo et al., 2017), emphasizing Tacotron's direct prediction of raw spectrograms as a distinguishing feature.

Overall, Tacotron offers a promising approach to text-to-speech synthesis by simplifying the system architecture, improving naturalness in speech synthesis, and enabling training on large and diverse datasets.
