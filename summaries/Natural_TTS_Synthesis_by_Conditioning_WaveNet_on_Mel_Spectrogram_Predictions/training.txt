Summary of Neural Network Training Procedure and Hyperparameters:

The neural network in the study was trained using a batch size of 64 on a single GPU. The Adam optimizer was utilized with a learning rate that started at 10^-3 and exponentially decayed to 10^-5 after 50,000 iterations. L2 regularization with a weight of 10^-6 was applied to the model. The network architecture included an encoder and a decoder with attention, and regularization techniques like dropout and zoneout were employed on convolutional and LSTM layers. The training loss was minimized using the summed mean squared error (MSE), with experiments conducted on log-likelihood loss using a Mixture Density Network that did not yield improved results. Overall, the training procedure involved careful selection of hyperparameters, regularization techniques, and loss functions to optimize the neural network's performance.
