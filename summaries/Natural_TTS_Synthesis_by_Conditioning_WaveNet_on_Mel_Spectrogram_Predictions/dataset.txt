Based on the details provided in the context, the dataset used to train the neural network in the machine learning paper consists of normalized character sequences and corresponding speech waveforms. Specifically, the dataset is an internal US English dataset containing 24.6 hours of speech from a single professional female speaker. All text in the dataset is spelled out, such as writing "16" as "sixteen," indicating that the models are trained on normalized text.

Overall Summary of the Dataset:
- Dataset Type: Internal US English dataset
- Speech Data: 24.6 hours of speech
- Speaker: Single professional female speaker
- Text Format: All text is spelled out (normalized text)

This dataset appears to be focused on speech recognition or related tasks, where the neural network is trained to understand and generate speech based on the corresponding text sequences.
