The neural network architecture described in the paper consists of two components: 
(1) a recurrent sequence-to-sequence feature prediction network with attention that predicts mel spectrogram frames from an input character sequence, and 
(2) a modified version of WaveNet that generates time-domain waveform samples conditioned on the predicted mel spectrogram frames.

The neural network architecture described in the paper includes an encoder and a decoder with attention. The encoder converts a character sequence into a hidden feature representation, which the decoder uses to predict a spectrogram. The decoder is an autoregressive recurrent neural network that predicts a mel spectrogram frame by frame. Additionally, a WaveNet vocoder architecture is used to invert the mel spectrogram feature representation into time-domain waveform samples.

The neural network architecture used in the paper is a modified WaveNet.

The neural network architecture used in the paper is Tacotron 2, which is a fully neural TTS system that combines a sequence-to-sequence recurrent network with attention to predict mel spectrograms with a modified WaveNet vocoder.
