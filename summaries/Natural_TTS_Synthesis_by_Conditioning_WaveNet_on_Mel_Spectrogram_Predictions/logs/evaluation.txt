The paper presents an evaluation of the neural network model, stating that "Our model achieves a mean opinion score (MOS) of 4.53 comparable to a MOS of 4.58 for professionally recorded speech." Additionally, the authors conduct ablation studies of key components of the system and evaluate the impact of using mel spectrograms as the conditioning input to WaveNet.

The paper discusses the evaluation of the neural network model in terms of spectrogram prediction and WaveNet vocoder architecture. The evaluation includes the use of mean squared error (MSE) for training convergence, experimentation with log-likelihood loss using Mixture Density Network, and the application of regularization techniques such as dropout and zoneout. Additionally, the model simplifies the building blocks compared to the original Tacotron, using LSTM and convolutional layers instead of CBHG stacks and GRU layers. The WaveNet vocoder architecture is modified to generate time-domain waveform samples from mel spectrogram features using a mixture of logistic distributions.

Table 1 shows a comparison of our method against various prior systems. In order to better isolate the effect of using mel spectrograms as features, we compare to a WaveNet conditioned on linguistic features with similar modifications to the WaveNet architecture as introduced above. We also compare to the original Tacotron that predicts linear spectrograms and uses Griffin-Lim to synthesize audio, as well as concatenative and parametric baseline systems, both of which have been used in production at Google. We find that the proposed system significantly outperforms all other TTS systems, and results in an MOS comparable to that of the ground truth audio.

The evaluation of the neural network in the paper includes metrics such as Mean Opinion Score (MOS) for different configurations and comparisons. For example, the MOS scores for the system when WaveNet is trained on predicted/ground truth mel spectrograms are provided, showing the impact of training data on synthesis quality. Additionally, comparisons are made between different vocoders and conditioning inputs, highlighting the importance of post-processing networks and receptive field sizes in generating high-quality audio.
