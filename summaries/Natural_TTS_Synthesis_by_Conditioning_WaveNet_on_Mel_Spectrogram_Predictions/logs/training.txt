The paper describes Tacotron 2, a neural network architecture for speech synthesis directly from text. The system consists of a recurrent sequence-to-sequence feature prediction network that maps character embeddings to mel-scale spectrograms, followed by a modified WaveNet model acting as a vocoder to synthesize time-domain waveforms from those spectrograms. The authors mention that the model achieves a mean opinion score (MOS) of 4.53, comparable to a MOS of 4.58 for professionally recorded speech. They also present ablation studies of key components of the system and evaluate the impact of using mel spectrograms as the conditioning input to WaveNet instead of linguistic, duration, and F0 features. The use of mel-frequency spectrograms as an intermediate representation allows for a significant reduction in the size of the WaveNet architecture.

The paper provides detailed information on the architecture and training process of the neural network used for spectrogram prediction and audio generation. However, specific details such as batch size, learning rate, number of epochs or steps, and losses are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context.

The training setup involved training the feature prediction network with a batch size of 64 on a single GPU using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10^-3 exponentially decaying to 10^-5 starting after 50,000 iterations. L2 regularization with weight 10^-6 was applied. The modiÔ¨Åed WaveNet was trained on ground truth-aligned predictions of the feature prediction network with a batch size of 128 distributed across 32 GPUs using the Adam optimizer with a fixed learning rate of 10^-4. An exponentially-weighted moving average of the network parameters was maintained over update steps with a decay of 0.9999 for inference. The waveform targets were scaled by a factor of 127.5 to bring the initial outputs of the mixture of logistics layer closer to the eventual distributions.
