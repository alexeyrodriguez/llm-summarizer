The paper does not provide specific information related to how the neural network was trained, such as batch size, learning rate, number of epochs, or losses.

Page 1:
The paper provides information on the training of the neural network used in the study. The network is composed of an encoder and a decoder with attention, with specific details on the architecture and components used. Regularization techniques such as dropout and zoneout are applied to the convolutional and LSTM layers. The training loss is minimized using the summed mean squared error (MSE) and experiments with log-likelihood loss using a Mixture Density Network were conducted but did not lead to better results.

The neural network was trained with a batch size of 64 on a single GPU using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 10^-3 exponentially decaying to 10^-5 starting after 50,000 iterations. L2 regularization with weight 10^-6 was applied.
