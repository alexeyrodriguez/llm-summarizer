The paper does not mention the specific dataset used to train the neural network.

Page 2:
The dataset used to train the neural network in the machine learning paper is described as follows:

"We train all models on an internal US English dataset[ 12], which contains 24.6 hours of speech from a single professional female speaker. All text in our datasets is spelled out. e.g., “16” is written as “sixteen”, i.e., our models are all trained on normalized text."
