The neural network described in the context is a combination of a recurrent sequence-to-sequence feature prediction network with attention and a modified version of WaveNet. The network architecture includes an encoder-decoder structure with attention, where the encoder converts a character sequence into a hidden feature representation, and the decoder predicts mel spectrogram frames. The decoder is an autoregressive recurrent neural network that predicts spectrogram frames, and a WaveNet vocoder is used to generate time-domain waveform samples based on the predicted mel spectrogram frames.

Overall, the neural network architecture described in the context is a sophisticated system that combines sequence-to-sequence prediction with attention mechanisms and WaveNet technology to generate high-quality speech synthesis.
