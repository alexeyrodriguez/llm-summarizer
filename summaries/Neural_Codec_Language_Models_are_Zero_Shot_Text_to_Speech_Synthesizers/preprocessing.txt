Overall Summary of Data Preprocessing for Training:

1. The data preprocessing for training involved using a pre-trained neural audio codec model, EnCodec, which encodes audio samples into discrete acoustic codes. This model utilizes residual vector quantization with specific quantizers based on bitrate settings to generate real-valued embeddings for waveform reconstruction at 24 kHz.

2. During training, waveform data is randomly cropped to lengths between 10 seconds and 20 seconds. Phoneme alignments are used as prompts, consecutive repetitions in force-aligned phoneme sequences are removed, and random segments of 3-second waveforms are selected for NAR acoustic prompt tokens.

3. Different prompts are used to train the NAR model, including NAR-no prompt (without prompts), NAR-phn prompt (using only phoneme sequences), and NAR-2 prompts (utilizing both phoneme and acoustic token prompts). The addition of prompts significantly impacts the model's performance in terms of Word Error Rate (WER) and speaker similarity scores.

4. VALL-E was pre-trained with 60K hours of speech data, although specific details on data preprocessing for this pre-training are not provided in the context.

Overall, the data preprocessing for training involves utilizing pre-trained models, cropping waveforms, using phoneme alignments as prompts, removing repetitions in phoneme sequences, selecting random segments for acoustic prompts, and experimenting with different prompt settings to improve model performance.
