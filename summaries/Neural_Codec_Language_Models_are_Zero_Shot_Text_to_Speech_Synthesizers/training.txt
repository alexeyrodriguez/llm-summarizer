Neural Network Training Details:

1. Model Name: VALL-E
2. Training Data: LibriLight corpus with 60K hours of English speech and over 7000 unique speakers
3. Data Characteristics: Contains noisy speech and inaccurate transcriptions, diverse speakers, and prosodies
4. Training Approach: Robust to noise, generalizes well by leveraging large data
5. Dataset Size Comparison: Training data over hundreds of times larger than typical TTS systems
6. Training Hardware: 16 NVIDIA TESLA V100 32GB GPUs
7. Batch Size: 6k acoustic tokens per GPU
8. Training Steps: 800k steps
9. Optimizer: AdamW optimizer
10. Learning Rate: Warm up to a peak of 5×10−4 for the first 32k updates, then linear decay
11. Model Architecture: Hierarchical structure with residual quantization, autoregressive and non-autoregressive language models
12. Training Experiments: Ablation experiments on NAR model with different prompt settings
13. Evaluation Metrics: WER (Word Error Rate) and speaker similarity scores used for evaluation

Note: Specific details such as batch size, learning rate, number of epochs or steps, and losses were not provided in the context for all parts of the neural network training.
