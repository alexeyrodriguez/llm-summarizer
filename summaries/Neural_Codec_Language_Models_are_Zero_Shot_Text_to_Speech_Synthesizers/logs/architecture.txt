The neural network architecture mentioned in the paper is as follows:

"The pipeline of VALL-E is phoneme→discrete code→waveform. VALL-E generates the discrete audio codec codes based on phoneme and acoustic code prompts, corresponding to the target content and the speaker’s voice."

Page 1:
The neural network architecture used in the paper is VALL-E, a language model based TTS framework leveraging large, diverse, and multi-speaker speech data.

Page 2:
The neural network architecture mentioned in the paper is VALL-E, which is described as the first TTS framework with strong in-context learning capabilities similar to GPT-3.

Page 3:
The neural audio codec model utilizes RVQ, with the first quantizer playing the most important role in reconstruction, and the impact from others gradually decreasing.

Page 4:
The neural network architecture used in the paper is a convolutional encoder-decoder model called EnCodec.

Page 5:
The neural network architecture described in the paper includes an Autoregressive Codec Language Modeling component, which generates tokens from the first quantizer using a phoneme embedding, an acoustic embedding, a transformer decoder, and a prediction layer. The model input consists of the concatenation of phoneme sequence and codebook tokens, with position embeddings computed separately. The model is optimized to maximize the probability of the next token in the first codebook.

Page 6:
The neural network architecture for the Non-Autoregressive Codec Language Modeling includes eight separate acoustic embedding layers, with the model trained to maximize acoustic tokens from the i-th quantizer codebook. The NAR model allows each token to attend to all input tokens in the self-attention layer and shares parameters between the acoustic embedding layer and the output prediction layer.

Page 7:
The neural network architecture for both the AR model and the NAR model includes:
- Transformer architecture with 12 layers
- 16 attention heads
- Embedding dimension of 1024
- Feed-forward layer dimension of 4096
- Dropout of 0.1

The neural network architecture used in the paper is the NAR model, which is trained with different prompts to improve ASR and speaker similarity evaluations. The settings include NAR-no prompt, NAR-phn prompt, and NAR-2 prompts, each utilizing different prompts for training and evaluation.

Page 9:
The paper discusses an ablation study of the NAR and AR models, highlighting the importance of prompts for speaker identity. The NAR model with prompts significantly improves speaker similarity scores. Additionally, the paper evaluates speaker similarity on the VCTK dataset, showing that longer prompts lead to more similar speech generation.
