The data preprocessing for training involved using a pre-trained neural audio codec model, EnCodec, which encodes audio samples into discrete acoustic codes. The model utilizes residual vector quantization with a specific configuration of quantizers based on bitrate settings to generate real-valued embeddings for waveform reconstruction at 24 kHz.

The text related to how the data was preprocessed for training is as follows:

"During training, we randomly crop the waveform to a random length between 10 seconds and 20 seconds. Its corresponding phoneme alignments are used as the phoneme prompt. We remove the consecutive repetitions in the force-aligned phoneme sequence. For the NAR acoustic prompt tokens, we select a random segment waveform of 3 seconds from the same utterance."

The paper discusses the preprocessing of data for training the NAR model, where different prompts are used to improve performance. The NAR-no prompt setting is trained without any prompts, NAR-phn prompt uses only phoneme sequences as prompts, and NAR-2 prompts utilizes both phoneme and acoustic token prompts. The addition of prompts significantly impacts the model's performance in terms of WER and speaker similarity scores.
