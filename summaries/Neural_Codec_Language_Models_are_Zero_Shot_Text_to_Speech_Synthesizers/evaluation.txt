Summary of Neural Network Evaluation Details:

The evaluation of the VALL-E neural codec language model for text-to-speech synthesis shows significant improvements over state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS systems. The model outperforms baselines in terms of speech naturalness, speaker similarity, and emotion preservation. Evaluation results on LibriSpeech and VCTK datasets demonstrate improvements in comparative mean opinion score (CMOS) and similarity mean opinion score (SMOS) compared to existing systems. VALL-E shows better performance in terms of robustness and fidelity to the given text and enrolled speech when compared to other speech-to-speech LM-based generative systems. Human evaluation with 60 speakers on VCTK further confirms the model's superiority in terms of SMOS and CMOS scores compared to the baseline and ground truth. Additionally, the model's ability to synthesize speech with higher speaker similarity, consistency in acoustic environment, and maintenance of speaker emotion are highlighted in the qualitative analysis. Overall, the evaluation results indicate that VALL-E is a state-of-the-art model for text-to-speech synthesis with promising performance metrics across various datasets and evaluation criteria.
